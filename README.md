# ChatGPTO App

This app is a container for the ChatGPT language model, allowing users to interact with the model through a React Native interface on macOS. The model's response is displayed in a webview within the app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   git clone https://github.com/prodinshape/chatgpto-macos.git
   cd chatgpto-macos

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the React Native development server:
   npm start

4. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run the app on your simulator or device:
   npx react-native run-macos

5. The app should now be running on your simulator or device.

## Using the App

Once the app is running, you can interact with the ChatGPT model by typing in a query in the input field and clicking the "Submit" button. The model's response will be displayed in the webview within the app.

## Limitations

- The ChatGPT model used in this app is currently only available for macOS.
- The model is running on a local server, so internet connection is required for the app to function.

## Additional Resources

- [OpenAI's GPT-3 API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
- [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to modify the code to fit your needs and also this README is based on the assumption that you have the API key for OpenAI API and also the ChatGPT model endpoint.
